### Fill Out the Checklist
Complete the following checklist to make sure you completed all parts of the module.  Mark your response with **Yes** or **No**.  If the answer is **No** then additionally describe what was preventing you from completing this step.

|Question                                                                                         |Your Response|Comments|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-|-|
|Did you implement the entire set of unique requirements as described in the Module Description document in I-Learn? | Yes*| |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code in your software and include useful comments?                              |Yes | |
|Did you use the correct README.md template from the Module Description document in I-Learn?                         | Yes | |
|Did you completely populate the README.md template?                                                                 | Yes | |
|Did you create the video, publish it on YouTube, and reference it in the README.md file?                            | Yes | |
|Did you publish the code with the README.md (in the top-level folder) into a public GitHub repository?              |Yes | |
 
 - I completed the requirements, but I found it to be too difficult to allow the user to input any tag they wanted. Some tagss do not hold any data (like a href, or img), but hold links instead. I can visualize how I would expand the program to accept this, but it would nearly double the duration of the project.

### Did you complete a Stretch Challenge 
I think my project meets the stretch requirements? I used several different variable pointers and passed them through functions. In Rust, this is called slicing or splicing. You aren't actually passing a variable in, but rather a reference to that variable.

### Record your time
How many hours did you spend on this module and the team project this Sprint?  
*Include all time including planning, researching, implementation, troubleshooting, documentation, video production, and publishing.*

|              |Hours|

|Individual Module | 12.5|
|Team Project      | 3 |

### Retrospective
- **What learning strategies worked well in this module?**
  For this module, I heavily used code from several different tutorials. I still customized and went more in-depth then the used code did, and ultimately it is my code. I basically reverse-engineered the main scraping tutorial to work for different tags. Relying on tutorials definitly made this project more comprehensible, for me at least.
- **What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?**
  Back to reverse-engineering, I thought I could complete my four scrapes from that code alone. What I didn't consider was the scraping changes depending on how the tag holds information (img tags vs. paragraph). It's very hard to learn everything from one part of something, when every part uses different application. From a gospel standpoint, you could even say that you must utilize every part of the gospel, you can't learn everything from one section, or even one book (BOM is very close though). Everything has to be used together in tandem.
- **How can you improve in the next module?**
  Dedicating more time to exploratory options. Most generic scrapers (like this one) only pull down information from static websites. Other options, like headless chromium, let you pull dynamically added elements addition to their static elements. My point being, I didn't anticipate this option, and it threw my project off by about 2 hours. Giving myself more lee-way time to prepare for the unexpected will be a great step in the right direction.
